# Revolution 
Congrats to myself! After I've started learning the basics of html and css 2 weeks ago I never thought that I would be able to create a whole website from scratch. Well, I have to say that I'm sure that the code looks like a mess - but it was my first try.

For smooth scrolling I worked with JavaScript and the help of 1-2 tutorials from Youtube.

Revolution was built without any frameworks.

# Important
The website is absolutely not responsive! I think that I will rebuild the website with the help of Bootstrap. Updates will come!
