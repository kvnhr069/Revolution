# Revolution 
Congrats to myself! After I've started learning the basics of html and css 2 weeks ago I never thought that I would be able to create a whole website from scratch. Well, I have to say that I'm sure that the code looks like a mess - but it was my first try.

For smooth scrolling I worked with JavaScript and the help of 1-2 tutorials from Youtube.

# About the Project
In general I'm a big fan of outstanding designs. So my first website should have been something that points with its look - I think its pretty cool. As a placeholder product I used the new iPhone X. Pictures and Icons are from unsplash.com and flaticon.com - both are awesome ressources for high resolution pictures and icons.

Revolution was built without any frameworks.

# Important
The website is absolutely not responsive! I think that I will rebuild the website with the help of Bootstrap. Updates will come!
